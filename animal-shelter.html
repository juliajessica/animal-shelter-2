      <p><span class="profile"> Squid</span> have gills just like fish. They are often mistaken for octopus. While they two are similar they are different types of creatures.</p>
      <p>Every squid features three hearts. They also move through the water tail first instead of head first.</p>
      <p>The <span class="profile">ink sac</span> can be triggered to release this black substance very rapidly.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Big Fin Squid species</strong> has ten arms while all of the others only feature eight of them. They are also all the same length which is interesting because other species feature arms that are of various lengths.</p>

        <p>Most of the time squid are loners in the waters. However, there have been small groups of them identified. This can be due to many young being born in one location. When food sources are scarce or predators are a huge danger though they seem to group together in order to hunt easier and to stay alive.</p>

        <p>There is still a great deal that we don’t know about the squid though. As researchers are able to uncover more of the mystery, new facts come to life for us to benefit from. Make sure you explore the internet as well as books for that new information on a regular basis. That way you can always keep on top of what is going on with these fascinating creatures.</p>

      <h2>Giraffe</h2>

      <p><span class="profile"> Giraffes</span> are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as <span class="profile">35 miles an hour</span> over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>
      <p>Giraffes are the <strong>tallest mammal</strong> in the world. Their long legs and necks help them to eat leaves at the top of tall trees that other animals cannot reach. They have long tongues, and no teeth at the front of their top jaw, which helps them to rip leaves from branches. Male giraffes use their necks for fighting, swinging them from side to side to headbutt their opponent.</p>

      </br>
        <p>Giraffes only need to drink water once every couple of days. They get most of their water from their plant-based diet—which is good considering their height makes the process of drinking difficult (and, if a lion happens upon a drinking giraffe, even dangerous).</p>
        <p>Because of their unusual shape, giraffes have a highly-specialized cardiovascular system that starts with an enormous heart. It's two feet long and weighs up to 25 pounds.</p>

      <h2>Porcupine</h2>

      <img src="img/porcupine.jpg" alt="image of porcupine">
      <p>The <span class="profile"> porcupine </span> is the prickliest of rodents, though its Latin name means <span class="profile">“quill pig.”</span> There are more than two dozen porcupine species, and all boast a coat of needle-like quills to give predators a sharp reminder that this animal is no easy meal. Some quills, like those of Africa's crested porcupine, are nearly a foot long.</p>
      <p>Porcupines have soft hair, but on their back, sides, and tail it is usually mixed with <strong>sharp quills</strong>. These quills typically lie flat until a porcupine is threatened, then leap to attention as a persuasive deterrent. Porcupines cannot shoot them at predators as once thought, but the quills do detach easily when touched.</p>

      <div class="text-show-3">
      </br>
        <p>Female porcupines have between one and four young, depending on the species. Babies have soft quills at birth, which harden within a few days. Most young porcupines are ready to live on their own at about two months of age.</p>
