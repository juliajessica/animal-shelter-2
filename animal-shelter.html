      <h2>Squid</h2>

      <p>Squid have gills just like fish. They are often mistaken for octopus. While they two are similar they are different types of creatures.</p>
      <p>Every squid features three hearts. They also move through the water tail first instead of head first.</p>
      <p>The ink sac can be triggered to release this black substance very rapidly.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Big Fin Squid species</strong> has ten arms while all of the others only feature eight of them. They are also all the same length which is interesting because other species feature arms that are of various lengths.</p>

      <h2>Giraffe</h2>
      <img src="img/giraffe.jpg" alt="image of giraffe">
      <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>
      <p>Giraffes are the <strong>tallest mammal</strong> in the world. Their long legs and necks help them to eat leaves at the top of tall trees that other animals cannot reach. They have long tongues, and no teeth at the front of their top jaw, which helps them to rip leaves from branches. Male giraffes use their necks for fighting, swinging them from side to side to headbutt their opponent.</p>

      <h2>Porcupine</h2>
      <img src="img/porcupine.jpg" alt="image of porcupine">
      <p>The porcupine is the prickliest of rodents, though its Latin name means “quill pig.” There are more than two dozen porcupine species, and all boast a coat of needle-like quills to give predators a sharp reminder that this animal is no easy meal. Some quills, like those of Africa's crested porcupine, are nearly a foot long.</p>
      <p>Porcupines have soft hair, but on their back, sides, and tail it is usually mixed with <strong>sharp quills</strong>. These quills typically lie flat until a porcupine is threatened, then leap to attention as a persuasive deterrent. Porcupines cannot shoot them at predators as once thought, but the quills do detach easily when touched.</p>
